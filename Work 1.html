        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>The site did not capture the hope and optimism that the product can provide people in need. It was overloaded with programs that were not differentiated from one another.</p>

              <p>Major issues:</p>             
                <ul>
                <li>It’s hard to differentiate between the various benefits.</li>
              <li>The questionaire was a roadblocker. You had to use it to get to the benefits but you there was no way of knowing how long it went on for.</li>
              <li>The general look and feel of the site was drab and dreary. It did not speak to the potential for the products to lift people in need out of their circumstances.</li></ul>

                        <h4>The Solution</h4>
                        <p>Our redesign focused on simplifying the and revitalizing the UI/UX design. Here’s how we did it:</p>
                        <ul><li>We created a new color scheme consisting of blues and greens, punctuated with a cheerful pink and purple. </li>
                        <li>We reorganized the top navigation to focus on the benefits. </li>
                        <li>We eliminated much of the text that was burdening the page and the viewing experience of the visitors.</li>
                        <li>We redesigned the logo with a modern touch.</li></ul>
